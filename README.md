> **‚ö†Ô∏è Experimental Project Notice**
> 
> This library was created as an experiment to explore whether AI could successfully convert a Python library to Swift. It's a port of Python's [dateutil](https://github.com/dateutil/dateutil) parser, developed with Claude Code as a proof of concept for AI-assisted library conversion.
> 
> While the library is functional and well-tested (69 tests), please be aware of its experimental nature when considering it for production use.

A Swift port of Python's powerful [dateutil](https://github.com/dateutil/dateutil) parser, created with Claude Code. This open-source library brings the flexibility and robustness of Python's date parsing capabilities to the Swift ecosystem, providing natural language date parsing, multiple format support, and advanced NLP-based date extraction from text.

## Features

- üìÖ **Multiple Date Format Support**: Parse dates in various formats (ISO, US, EU, etc.)
- üó£Ô∏è **Natural Language Processing**: Extract dates from natural text
- üîÑ **Relative Date Parsing**: Understand "tomorrow", "3 days ago", "next week", etc.
- üåç **Locale Support**: Respects system locale for date interpretation
- ‚ö° **High Performance**: Optimized for speed with caching mechanisms
- üß™ **Comprehensive Tests**: Extensive test coverage
- üì± **Cross-Platform**: Works on macOS, iOS, tvOS, and watchOS

## Python dateutil Compatibility

This Swift port implements the core functionality of Python's dateutil.parser with Swift-native enhancements:

### ‚úÖ Supported Features
- **parse()** function with fuzzy parsing
- **dayfirst** and **yearfirst** parameters
- Relative date parsing (tomorrow, yesterday, etc.)
- Multiple date format recognition
- Natural language date extraction (enhanced with Apple's NLP)

### üöß Differences from Python
- Returns Swift `Date` objects instead of Python `datetime`
- Uses Swift's error handling with `throw`/`try` instead of exceptions
- Enhanced NLP capabilities using Apple's Natural Language framework
- No timezone parsing (uses system timezone by default)

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

Add SwiftDateParser to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/doozMen/SwiftDateParser.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

Or add it through Xcode:
1. File ‚Üí Add Package Dependencies
2. Enter: `https://github.com/doozMen/SwiftDateParser.git`
3. Click Add Package

## Usage

### Basic Date Parsing

```swift
import SwiftDateParser

// Simple parsing
let date = try SwiftDateParser.parse("2024-03-15")
let relativeDate = try SwiftDateParser.parse("tomorrow")
let naturalDate = try SwiftDateParser.parse("March 15, 2024 at 3:30 PM")
```

### Advanced Parser Configuration

```swift
// Create a custom parser
let parser = SwiftDateParser.createParser(
    dayfirst: true,      // Interpret 01/02/03 as 1 Feb 2003
    yearfirst: false,    // Year doesn't come first
    fuzzy: true,         // Enable fuzzy parsing
    defaultDate: Date()  // Use current date for missing components
)

let date = try parser.parse("15/03/24")
```

### Natural Language Date Extraction

```swift
// Extract dates from text
let text = """
The meeting is scheduled for tomorrow at 3 PM. 
Please submit the report by December 15, 2023.
We'll review it next week.
"""

let extractedDates = SwiftDateParser.extractDates(from: text)

for extracted in extractedDates {
    print("Found: '\(extracted.text)' -> \(extracted.date)")
    print("Confidence: \(extracted.confidence)")
}
```

### Extract Dates with Context

```swift
let extractor = SwiftDateParser.createExtractor()
let results = extractor.extractDatesWithContext(from: text, contextWords: 5)

for (date, context) in results {
    print("Date: \(date.text)")
    print("Context: \(context)")
}
```

## Supported Date Formats

### Standard Formats
- ISO 8601: `2024-03-15T10:30:00`
- US Format: `03/15/2024`, `3/15/24`
- EU Format: `15/03/2024`, `15.03.2024`
- Long Format: `March 15, 2024`
- Compact: `20240315`

### Relative Dates
- Simple: `today`, `tomorrow`, `yesterday`
- With numbers: `3 days ago`, `in 2 weeks`
- Next/Last: `next Monday`, `last month`

### Natural Language
- `The 3rd of May 2024`
- `December 25th at 3:30 PM`
- `Next Tuesday afternoon`
- `2 weeks from today`

## API Reference

### SwiftDateParser

#### `parse(_:fuzzy:)`
Parses a date string and returns a Date object.

```swift
static func parse(_ dateString: String, fuzzy: Bool = true) throws -> Date
```

#### `extractDates(from:)`
Extracts all dates found in the given text.

```swift
static func extractDates(from text: String) -> [NLPDateExtractor.ExtractedDate]
```

### DateParser

The core parsing engine with configurable options.

```swift
let parser = DateParser(parserInfo: parserInfo, calendar: calendar, locale: locale)
let date = try parser.parse("2024-03-15")
```

### NLPDateExtractor

Advanced natural language date extraction.

```swift
let extractor = NLPDateExtractor()
let dates = extractor.extractDates(from: "Meeting tomorrow at 3 PM")
```

## Examples

### Email Date Extraction

```swift
let email = """
Subject: Quarterly Review

Hi team,

Our Q1 review is scheduled for March 15, 2024 at 2 PM EST.
Please submit your reports by end of day tomorrow.

The deadline for Q2 planning is April 1st.

Best regards
"""

let dates = SwiftDateParser.extractDates(from: email)
// Extracts: "March 15, 2024 at 2 PM EST", "tomorrow", "April 1st"
```

### Calendar Event Parsing

```swift
let events = [
    "Team standup every Monday at 9 AM",
    "Project deadline: 2024-06-30",
    "Vacation from July 15 to July 22",
    "Conference in 3 months"
]

for event in events {
    if let dates = SwiftDateParser.extractDates(from: event).first {
        print("Event: \(event)")
        print("Date: \(dates.date)")
    }
}
```

## Error Handling

```swift
do {
    let date = try SwiftDateParser.parse("invalid date")
} catch DateParserError.unableToParseDate(let string) {
    print("Could not parse: \(string)")
} catch {
    print("Unexpected error: \(error)")
}
```

## Performance

SwiftDateParser is optimized for performance with two parser implementations:

### DateParser2 (Default)
- Full feature set including all date formats
- Cached date formatters
- Pre-compiled regex patterns
- Typical parsing: 0.1-1ms

### DateParser3 (Optimized)
- ~10x faster than DateParser2
- Simplified feature set for common formats
- Ideal for high-performance scenarios
- Typical parsing: 0.01-0.1ms

To use the optimized parser:
```swift
let parser = SwiftDateParser.createParserV3()
let date = try parser.parse("2024-03-15")
```

## About This Port

SwiftDateParser is an open-source Swift implementation of Python's [dateutil](https://github.com/dateutil/dateutil) parser, created entirely with Claude Code. This port aims to bring the same powerful and flexible date parsing capabilities that Python developers have enjoyed for years to the Swift community.

### Key Differences from Python's dateutil

- **Native Swift Implementation**: Built from the ground up using Swift's type system and language features
- **Platform Integration**: Leverages Apple's Natural Language framework for enhanced NLP capabilities
- **Swift-First API**: Designed to feel natural in Swift with proper error handling and optionals
- **Performance Optimized**: Takes advantage of Swift's performance characteristics

## Acknowledgments

- Based on Python's [dateutil](https://github.com/dateutil/dateutil) library
- Ported to Swift using Claude Code
- Uses Swift's native Natural Language framework
- Built with Swift Package Manager
