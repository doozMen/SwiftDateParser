| 3 days ago | 0.295 | 0.009 | 32.8x | From 33.0x |

✨ = Swift is faster than Python!

### Overall Performance Metrics
- **Average performance ratio**: 10.71x slower (improved from 71x in v1)
- **Best case**: 0.17x (Swift 6x faster than Python for ISO formats)
- **Worst case**: 40.99x slower (cold start on first parse)

## Test Coverage Analysis

### Well-Covered Areas
1. **ISO 8601 formats** - 100% coverage with excellent performance
2. **Common date formats** - Good coverage of US/EU formats
3. **Time parsing** - Complete coverage of time-only formats
4. **Timezone handling** - Full support for ISO timezone formats
5. **Relative dates** - Good coverage in fuzzy mode

### Areas Needing Improvement
1. **Advanced fuzzy parsing** - Extracting dates from sentences
2. **Ordinal variations** - "May 3rd, 2001" style
3. **Legacy formats** - Apostrophe years, AD/BC markers
4. **Alternative separators** - Backslashes, underscores

## Recommendations

### For Production Use
The library is ready for production use in applications that:
- Primarily use ISO 8601 formats
- Need common date format parsing (MM/DD/YYYY, etc.)
- Require timezone-aware date parsing
- Use relative date parsing with fuzzy mode enabled

### For Future Development
Priority improvements for better compatibility:
1. Implement advanced fuzzy parsing with token extraction
2. Add support for more ordinal date formats
3. Support legacy year formats ('96)
4. Add configurable separator support

## Conclusion

SwiftDateParser v2 demonstrates strong test coverage and performance for common date parsing scenarios. With 81.1% of tests passing (including fuzzy mode) and some operations faster than Python, it provides a solid foundation for Swift applications needing flexible date parsing capabilities.
